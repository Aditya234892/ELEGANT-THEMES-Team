                                </a>
                                <p>Elegant Themes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of premium themes available for half the price that our competitors pay for a single theme!</p>

                                    <h4>Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?</h4>
                                </a>
                                <p>Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that you can install our themes to.</p>

                                </a>
                                <p>We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days of your purchase.

                                </a>
                                <p>Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your current package and instructions on how to upgrade.</p>

                                </a>
                                <p>Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.</p>
                                
                            </li>

                                </a>
                                <p>Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional design choices for their clients!</p>
                               
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                </a>
                                <p>If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that you have already downloaded forever.</p>
                                
                            </li>

                                    <h4>Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?</h4>
                                </a>
                                <p>Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme shops, and here you get access to a lot more!</p>
                                
                            </li>

                                </a>
                                <p>While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't working and you decide to use a different theme instead.</p>

                                    <h4>Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?</h4>
                                </a>
                                <p>Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.</p>
